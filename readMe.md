This application was created for my foundations capstone project and is called Ziti’s Notez. When downloading this project's repository make sure to run npm install, to install the dependencies that were used. Zizi’s notez is that helps you take notes. .Note taking is a useful tool for anyone. It makes our life easy, productive and simpler. I wanted to create a note taking app that helps keep track of little things  which we tend to forget in our day to day schedules such as meetings, lecture notes, grocery list, etc. 

As soon as the page loads, an event listener is triggered and a function I called getAllNotes gets called. This function makes an asynchronous request and fetches all notes from my server.  I created an HTML form where a user can enter a note title and body. Then, I added a JavaScript event handler that makes an asynchronous POST request using Axios to one of my server’s endpoints. After adding a note, a user will be able to see the existing note on the left side.  I wanted the user to be able to delete a note if it was no longer needed. When a user clicks the delete button, it tricks an event handler that calls a delete function. The delete function then  uses the id of the notes we are trying to delete and our delete function asynchronously calls the server.  I used HTML, CSS, JS, axios, express, and Node.js for my tech stack in order to build this application.
